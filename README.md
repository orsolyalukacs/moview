## Components & how they work
- App:       Moview app logo is shown on initial state, before a Search method has been fired. 
             One can search for movie titles, and once those are loaded, to related movies.
             A spinner is shown while data is being fetched from the API.
             If no movies found during search, displays an error message. 
- ButtonPrimary: Wraps Button component from Material UI in custom theme provided in utils directory.
- SearchBar: Input search field and logos. Search for a string (a movie title) after pressing the Enter key. 
- MovieCard: Shows movie poster image, title, release year, original language and rating.
             Shows a placeholder image if no poster image found.
             All data fetched from TMdb API in the component.
             If no string is in the Search ```input```, prevents from re-rendering.
- MovieGrid: Wraps MovieCard into a Material UI Grid layout.
- MovieInfo: Opens modal window with movie information after clicking the movie title. 
             Has 3 buttons: Wikipedia,TMDb, and Close button. 
             Initally movie extract is fetched from Wikipedia, if not found, it looks for equivalent TMdb overview.
             Show if the information is fetched from Wikipedia or TMDb in a ```sub``` tag.
             If no information found, gives an error message.

### Improvements to be made:
- Implement better search for Wikipedia: first run an open search and then query for the title.
- Outsource search expression strings to a config file and import to make the MovieCard component reusable.
- Add a search button to the SearchBar, so a user can search by clicking on it, not only using the enter key.
- Use Router and history to be able to go back after clicking _'Related'_.
- Write tests with Jest and enzyme.
